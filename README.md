# Travel Agency app
### Damian Andrei Horia

## Description

My project, "Travel Agency," consists of developing an application that allows users to search for a vacation package by location, book an offer, and cancel it. The reservation will be made based on a phone number, allowing users to check the trip details.
## Objectives

The project has the following objectives:

    Implementing a fast search system based on user preferences.
    Creating an attractive and easy-to-understand user interface.
    Developing a system that allows users to view details about their booked vacation and cancel it if needed.

## Architecture

The database will be created using MySQL, and the interface will be developed using Swing.
